### Puzzlebot_world

This package contains all files for running Gazebo simulation with Puzzlebot in it. 

There are several worlds and options to be edited for running the simulation.

For the particular solution, the important file is aruco_world_MCR.launch that loads aruco.world in Gazebo with the respective models.

You can run other worlds if desired by editing the world parameter in the launch file
